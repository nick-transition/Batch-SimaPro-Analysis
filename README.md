# Batch-SimaPro-Analysis

## About
This project was built to connect a modified version of the [Integrated Farm Systems Model](http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=8519) to SimaPro — a life cycle analysis tool.

## Getting Started
This project assumes you have access to the source code of IFSM as well as the following:
* Visual Studio
* SimaPro

### Add the SimaPro Library
Before executing the project you will want to ensure the SimaPro library is accessible to your project. You can learn more about SimaPro's COM interface in [this](https://www.pre-sustainability.com/download/Programming-The-SimaPro-COM-interface-oct2013.pdf) PDF.
